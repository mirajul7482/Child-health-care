    "details": "Immunizations protect children. Vaccine-preventable diseases have dangerous consequences, including seizures, brain damage, blindness and even death. Because of the success of the national immunization program, many young parents today have never seen a case of one of these illnesses, but measles, meningitis, chickenpox, pertussis and other diseases exist in the world and would re-emerge here if immunization rates fell. For example, recent outbreaks of measles in the US were traced to unvaccinated children who became infected while traveling in Europe."
